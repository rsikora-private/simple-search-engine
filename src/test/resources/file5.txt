We are expecting ‘production like’ code, i.e. fully tested (end to end) and well-structured code, but not necessarily feature complete
You should be spending 3-4 hours on the task, so basic functionality is better than a complex scoring algorithm and no console application.
External libraries are forbidden, other than test/mocking frameworks
Ranking score design — start with something basic,then iterate as time allows
The in-memory representation — searches should be relatively efficient
What constitutes a word?
What constitutes two words being equal (and matching)?
You should be using some VCS (git, svn). Make your commits production-like.
Use build tool (Maven/Gradle/SBT)
